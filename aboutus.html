    <h1>A safe, natural, pre-teen deodorant for those blossoming young girls who may appreciate a little extra support.</h1> <br><br>

        
        
        <p class="aboutus">In early 2023 Amanda , a paramedic with 20 years’ service in the NHS had that “lightbulb moment”. 
        
        The busy mum of 5, collected her youngest daughter aged 7 from a full day at school which had included PE .  
        
        Amanda says "It was obvious from putting my daughter in the car there was the distinct and strong  smell of body odour. 
        
        could this be happening to my 7-year-old daughter? Researching this, I was shocked to read that yes, girls as young as 7 can start to sweat and produce strong body odour.  Fortunately, my daughter is a confident and happy little girl, so we talked about 'smelly pits' and we made a little joke about it.  We then agreed a trip to the  local high street chemist to buy a 'girly deodorant'." 
        
        <br><br>
        And that’s when Amanda realised………………………………………………… 
        
        There are no deodorants for pre-teens, or indeed specifically for teens on the high street.  We ended up buying just a normal adult roll on, that wasn’t really aimed at anyone.   
        
        We then looked online, and found that there were children’s deodorants, however these were all so very expensive, with some as much as £15.  
        
        And that is when the “lightbulb moment” occurred. 
        
        Could we produce and supply a safe, quality product to the online market place and high street that is affordable and accessible for this ever-increasing number of young girls, and one that is age appropriate, safe, and environmentally friendly? 
        
        Spurred on by the desire to find a solution and make a difference to young girls’ lives, Amanda teamed up with INOVATE a business consultancy company, and put the idea to them.  INOVATE have been outstanding says Amanda, I would have had no idea where to go with this idea and they have got us to where we are today. </p>
